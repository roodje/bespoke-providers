## Registration details

In whole Redsys group there is no manual or dynamic registration. It is enough to use a valid eIDAS certificate (QWAC & QSEAL)
with a unique organization identifier (GURN - Global Unique Reference Number) during mutual TLS authentication and signing the request.
The Global Unique Reference Number is used as _Client Id_.

## Multiple Registration

As there is no registration required on bank side, we think that the only requirement is to have unique TPP number. As
long as we are using the same authentication means values we will be treated by the bank as the same client.

## Connection Overview

Swagger can be downloaded from developer portal, but during implementation process we discovered that it is deprecated,
so all model DTOs in our implementation were created manually based on documentation.

Documentation for the bank and swaggers can be found on their [developer portal][3]. To access those data you don't have
to login using any credentials.

Redsys group has specific authorization flow. During `getLoginInfo` step user is redirected to consent page. Next during
first call of `createAccessMeans` user is redirected once again to bank site. This time SCA consent has to be filled.
After that we have _consentId_ value, which is required to fetch data.

Additionally `X-Request-ID` header has specific behaviour. It has to be different each call, except calls for transactions pages.
What is more in this group of banks there is `PSU-IP-Address` header required. It means that there is no limit for usage
of bank's api when call is triggered by user and  this header is present. For flywheel calls in some banks there are limits.
Due to that fact in whole group `BackPressureRequestException` exception is thrown when we receive _429_ error code in response
during fetch data process. From application perspective it means that this result should be skipped, so user doesn't know
that there was something wrong.

When fetching accounts (_/accounts_ endpoint) parameter `withBalances` is not used, so information about balances are
collected separately.

In Redsys group we have to pay attention for transactions fetching time. In Evo Banco we are not aware of any limit so 
far, so we collect data based on value from _site-management_.

  participant ASPSP;
  PSU (via Yolt app)->>+Yolt (providers): getLoginInfo()
  Yolt (providers)->>-PSU (via Yolt app): authorization URL (first consent page)
  PSU (via Yolt app)->>+ASPSP: authenticate on consent page

  PSU (via Yolt app)->>+ASPSP: authenticate on consent page
  ASPSP->>-PSU (via Yolt app): redirect to Yolt with authorization code

  Yolt (providers)-->>PSU (via Yolt app): create and store access mean
  PSU (via Yolt app)->>+Yolt (providers): fetchData()
  loop Various data fetches
  Yolt (providers)->>+ASPSP: GET accounts, balances and transactions
  ASPSP->>-Yolt (providers): accounts, balances and transactions list
  end
  Yolt (providers)-->>PSU (via Yolt app): user data

```

## Sandbox overview

Sandbox has not been used.

## Consent validity rules

Consent testing is turned on. Consent validity rules are set to EMPTY_RULES_SET. We either get consent page, or we get 
error status.

## User Site deletion

This provider does NOT implement `onUserSiteDelete` method. 

## Business and technical decisions

## Certificate rotation

Rotation of certificates is easy process. Due to the fact that there is no registration required, we can just update
authentication means on our side. Remember that certificates have to contain the same Global Unique Reference Number.
Otherwise we also have to update _clientId_ authentication means and users will have to start from consent step, because
from bank's perspective we will be treated as other TPP.
