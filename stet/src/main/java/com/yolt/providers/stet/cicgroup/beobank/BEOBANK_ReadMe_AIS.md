## Registration details

Beobank has dynamic registration, and it is well described on bank's [developer portal][4]

The bank requires dynamic registration, autoonboarding is enabled. The registration is pretty normal, except
one thing, when registering one has to provide a Client Name (this field which will be later displayed in the client's
application - it is good to consult this value before typing it ).

There is also a possibility of multiple registration (information from the bank):
_Yes, you can use the OAuth 2 registration API to register multiple OAuth 2 client IDs. You can register multiple client
IDs for the same certificate, and each OAuth 2 client ID can have its own user-visible name, and will have its own set
of OAuth 2 tokens (authorization codes, refresh tokens, access tokens)._

During registration, you can register more than one redirect urls.

### Certificate rotation

TBD
