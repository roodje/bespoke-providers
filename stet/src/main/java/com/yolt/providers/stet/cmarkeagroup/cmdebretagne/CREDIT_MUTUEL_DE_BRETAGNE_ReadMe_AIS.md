## Registration details
The bank requires manual registration , one should log to the developer portal https://developer.arkea.com/ 
( credentials are standard ) and create a new app. Creation of the app requires pasting the X509 Certificate Chain.

### Multiple Registration
When registered in the Developer Portal, one can create multiple apps with various certificates.It is also possible 
to create multiple accounts with different addresses.

### Certificate rotation
When rotating certificates we need to change authmeans on our side (in APY) and simultaneously perform a change 
in the developer portal to avoid downtime.

## Connection Overview
The bank uses CavageSignatureStrategy for signing the requests, which uses the
following fields in this order '(request-target)', 'Digest' and  'X-Request-Id'and PSU-IP address.
The provider uses [RFC 7616][2] for calculating the digest with SHA-256 algorithm.

## User Site deletion
This provider does NOT implement `onUserSiteDelete` method.

## Business Decisions

Extended transaction history is not yet supported by CM Arkea, i.e. history including transactions older than 90 days.
Therefore we decided to narrow fetching time as a safe way to get data.

According to the documentation: Only Accounting Balance (CLBD) and Instant Balance (XPCD) are reported in the balances
endpoint.
CurrentBalance = XPCD
AvailableBalance = CLBD

C4PO-9794
We decided to filter pending transactions, because we had an issue with empty bookingDate.
And these transactions are filtered later by core team.

As discussed in https://git.yolt.io/providers/stet/-/merge_requests/120#note_739459 there is a decision to map valueDate.
