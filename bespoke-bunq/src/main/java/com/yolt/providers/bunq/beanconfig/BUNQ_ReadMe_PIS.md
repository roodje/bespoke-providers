## Registration details

Dynamic registration for Bunq are implemented. AIS and PIS share common registration. You need to have client
certificate id from HSM, client certificate and client certificate chain to perform registration. All those values are
available in APY.

## Connection Overview

Connection is described on Bunq's developer portal and can be found in [documentation][4]
Payment authorization url is the same for AIS and PIS and doesn't contain payment id as a parameter. During tests, it
was found out that all initiated payment will be shown for user on consent page and all of them have to be accepted or
rejected (or abandoned, but they will be waiting for user action)

## Sandbox overview

Sandbox is described in [documentation][3] but was never actively used by us when working with this bank connection.

## Business and technical decisions

During tests of payment logic, we have found that Bunq IBAN is required (as a debtor account) to perform payment
initiation. It means that there is validation of IBAN implemented on bank's side during this step.
