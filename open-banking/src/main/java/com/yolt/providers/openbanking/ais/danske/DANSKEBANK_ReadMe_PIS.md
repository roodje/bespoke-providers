## Registration details

Danske supports dynamic registration. Proper _/register_ endpoint described in [documentation][4].

## Multiple Registration

We don't know about any registration limits. There was no situation, when such knowledge was needed, so we will have to
ask about that when there will be such case.

## Connection Overview

Simplified sequence diagram:

```mermaid

  autonumber
  participant PSU (via Yolt app);
  participant Yolt (providers);
  participant ASPSP;
  PSU (via Yolt app)->>+Yolt (providers): initiateUkDomesticPayment()
  Yolt (providers)->>+ASPSP: POST client credentials grant 
  ASPSP->>-Yolt (providers): Bearer token
  Yolt (providers)->>+ASPSP: POST domestic payment consents 
  ASPSP->>-Yolt (providers): consentId
  Yolt (providers)->>-PSU (via Yolt app): authorization URL (with state and redirect url)
  PSU (via Yolt app)->>+ASPSP: authenticate on consent page
  ASPSP->>-PSU (via Yolt app): redirect to Yolt
  PSU (via Yolt app)->>+Yolt (providers): submitPayment()
  Yolt (providers)->>+ASPSP: POST domestic payments
  ASPSP->>-Yolt (providers): domesticPaymentId
  Yolt (providers)-->>PSU (via Yolt app): payment confirmation

```

**Consent validity rules**

Danske requires endToEndIdentification to be maximum 31-chars-long. The generic request in our consent-testing mechanism uses 35-chars-long one. Because of that, Danske is blacklisted.

## Sandbox overview

According to the documentation, there is a sandbox environment with the Payment Initiation Service, but it hasn't been
tested by us, as we do not have proper certificates we could use on our local machines.

## Business and technical decisions

During implementation we made following business decisions:

`RemittanceInformation.reference` is not required, but we still have so called `DynamicField` for that which is
optional.

02.03.2022 Due to agreements with yts-core it was decided that we want to treat payment as completed once money has been
deducted from debtor account. According to OB documentation `AcceptedSettlementCompleted` is proper status. For
reference see https://yolt.atlassian.net/browse/C4PO-9754
