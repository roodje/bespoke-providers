## Registration details

Revolut allows to [add][5] new app with dynamic registration, [update][6] it details and [delete][7] it.
All the above is well described in theirs [documentation][3].

Important note regarding Transport certificate subject name - this authentication mean is used as a value for 
jwt claim tls_client_auth_dn in registration payload. Revolut Eu expects this value to be in specific format.
Current implementation of BouncyCastle doesn't produce correct results for eIDAS certificates therefore
we need to use following command on transport certificate to obtain it:
```shell
openssl x509 -in /path/to/your/cert.pem -inform pem -noout -subject -nameopt RFC2253
```
Result of this command is prefixed with `subject=` which needs to be removed before saving as authentication mean.
For more details please consult this section of [documentation][8]


Current implementation of auto onboarding requires cleanup. It contains hardcoded redirect urls list and custom logic
which causes deletion of already existing app on Revolut side before registering new one. 
Besides RevolutEu expects issuer claim - but they don't expect anything specific in it. (And RevolutEu doesn't have softwareId claim as it is set in GB)

## Connection Overview

Revolut follows Open Banking 3.1.0 standard. It means that flow is similar to other banks. Due to that fact,
Open Banking DTOs are used in implementation, and code relay mostly on our generic Open Banking implementation.

## Sandbox overview

Sandbox is described in [documentation][3] but was never actively used by us when working with this bank connection.
