    # Summary

    FinecoBank PSD2 APIs are based on **NextGenPSD2** *Framework Version 1.3*
    which offers a modern, open, harmonised and interoperable set of Application
    Programming Interfaces (APIs) as the safest and most efficient way to
    provide data securely. For further details, use cases, and sequence diagrams,
    please refer to [NextGenPSD2 Download page](https://www.berlin-group.org/nextgenpsd2-downloads "NextGenPSD2 Download page")


    The NextGenPSD2 Framework reduces XS2A complexity and costs, addresses the
    problem of multiple competing standards in Europe and, aligned with the
    goals of the Euro Retail Payments Board, enables European banking customers
    to benefit from innovative products and services ('Banking as a Service') by
    granting TPPs safe and secure (authenticated and authorised) access to their
    bank accounts and financial data.

      description: >
        This method is used to initiate a payment at the ASPSP.


        ## Variants of Payment Initiation Requests


        This method to initiate a payment initiation at the ASPSP should be sent
        with a JSON body.


        This is the endpoint for the **payments** payment service:

        There are the following **payment products**:

          - Payment products with payment information in *JSON* format:
            - ***sepa-credit-transfers***
            - ***instant-sepa-credit-transfers***
            - ***target-2-payments***
            - ***cross-border-credit-transfers***


        ## Authorization sub-resource


        Since multi-level SCA is not available, the call to POST
        /v1/{payment-service}/{payment-product} will also internally generate
        the authorization sub-resource with its own authorization ID.


        This allows the TPP to call the GET
        /v1/{payment-service}/{payment-product}/{paymentId}/authorisations to
        list all the authorization IDs (only one ID in case of no multi-level SCA),
        and the GET
        /v1/{payment-service}/{payment-product}/{paymentId}/authorisations/{authorisationId}
        to see the status of the specific SCA.

        This method is used to initiate a periodic-payment cancellation at the ASPSP.


        ## Variants of Payment Cancellation Initiation Requests


        This is the endpoint for the **periodic-payments** payment service.

        There are the following **payment products**:

          - Payment products with payment information in *JSON* format:
            - ***sepa-credit-transfers***


        ## Authorization sub-resource


        Since multi-level SCA is not available, the call to POST
        /v1/{payment-service}/{payment-product} will also internally generate
        the authorization sub-resource with its own authorization ID.


        This allows the TPP to call the GET
        /v1/{payment-service}/{payment-product}/{paymentId}/authorisations to
        list all the authorization IDs (only one ID in case of no multi-level SCA),
        and the GET
        /v1/{payment-service}/{payment-product}/{paymentId}/authorisations/{authorisationId}
        to see the status of the specific SCA.

      tags:
      - Account Information Service (AIS)
      description: >
        This method create a consent resource, defining access rights to
        dedicated accounts of

        a given PSU-ID.

        Two different ways are supported to specify the accounts and type of consent that is requested.

        * **Detailed**: The accounts are addressed explicitly in the body of the request in the "accounts", "balances" and/or in the "transactions" arrays fields. Please note that a "transactions" or "balances" access right also gives access to the generic /accounts endpoints, i.e. is implicitly supporting also the "accounts" access.

        * **Bank-offered**: The accounts are no addressed in the body of the request. In the request body the "accounts", "balances" and "transactions" sub attribute within the "access" attribute are an empty array. FinecoBank will then agree bilaterally directly with the PSU on which accounts the requested access consent should be supported. The result can be retrieved by the TPP by using the GET Consent Request method.


        Consent requests specified using "allPsd2" and/or "availableAccounts" fields are not supported.


        **Side Effects**

        When this Consent Request is a request where the "recurringIndicator"
        equals "true",

        and if it exists already a former consent for recurring access on
        account information

        for the addressed PSU, then the former consent automatically expires as
        soon as the new

        consent request is authorised by the PSU.

        ## Authorization sub-resource


        Since multi-level SCA is not available, the call to POST
        /v1/consents will also internally generate
        the authorization sub-resource with its own authorization ID.


        This allows the TPP to call the GET
        /v1/consents/{consentId}/authorisations to
        list all the authorization IDs (only one ID in case of no multi-level SCA),
        and the GET
        /v1/consents/{consentId}/authorisations/{authorisationId}
        to see the status of the specific SCA.

        This method returns all the transactions for a given month.
        Therefore the "dateFrom" and "dateTo" attributes should be respectively valued with the first date
        and the last date of the month. Otherwise the method returns transactions occurred in the month

        Transactions older than 90 days are returned only if the PSU has given consent
        no more than **20 minutes** before the time of the request.
        Otherwise an error will be returned and a new consent request should be delivered.

        Creates a confirmation of funds request. Checks whether a specific amount is available at point of time of the request on an account linked to a given tuple card issuer(TPP)/card number, or addressed by IBAN and TPP respectively.
        In order to use this method, it is necessary that the PSU has given the related authorization for the TPP through FinecoBank.




        The following rules will apply in interpreting the Confirmation of Funds Request for multicurrency accounts:
          * The additional card number might support the choice of the sub-account.
          * If no card number, but the PSU account identifier is contained: check on default account registered by customer.
          * If no card number but the PSU and the account identifier with currency is contained: check the availability of funds on the corresponding sub-account.
          * If card number and the PSU account identifier is contained:: check on sub-account addressed by card, if the addressed card is registered with one of the sub-accounts.
          * If the card number is not registered for any of the accounts, the card number is ignored.

          **Warning:** this status is provided for transaction status reasons, not for financial information.
          It can only be used after bilateral agreement.
        - 'ACSP': 'AcceptedSettlementInProcess' -
          All preceding checks such as technical validation and customer profile were successful and therefore the payment initiation has been accepted for execution.
        - 'ACTC': 'AcceptedTechnicalValidation' -
          Authentication and syntactical and semantical validation are successful.
        - 'ACWC': 'AcceptedWithChange' -
          Instruction is accepted but a change will be made, such as date or remittance not sent.
        - 'ACWP': 'AcceptedWithoutPosting' -

        - 'RCVD': 'Received' -
          Payment initiation has been received by the receiving agent.
        - 'PDNG': 'Pending' -
          Payment initiation or individual transaction included in the payment initiation is pending.
          Further checks and status update will be performed.
        - 'RJCT': 'Rejected' -
          Payment initiation or individual transaction included in the payment initiation has been rejected.
        - 'CANC': 'Cancelled'
          Payment initiation has been cancelled before execution
          Remark: This code is still requested from ISO20022.
        - 'ACFC': 'AcceptedFundsChecked' -
          Preceding check of technical validation and customer profile was successful and an automatic funds check was positive .
          Remark: This code is still requested from ISO20022.
        - 'PATC': 'PartiallyAcceptedTechnical'
          Correct The payment initiation needs multiple authentications, where some but not yet all have been performed. Syntactical and semantical validations are successful.

        The following balance types are defined:
          - "closingBooked":
            Balance type returned only if a date range is specified in the request paramaters. It is the balance of the account at the end of the requested date range.
            It is the sum of the opening booked balance at the beginning of the date range specified and all entries booked
            to the account during date range. **(saldo contabile al termine del periodo specificato)**


          - "expected":
            Balance composed of booked entries and pending items known at the time of calculation,
            which projects the end of day balance if everything is booked on the account and no other entry is posted.

            For card accounts, this is composed of
              - invoiced, but not yet paid entries,
              - not yet invoiced but already booked entries and
              - pending items (not yet booked)

          - "authorised":
            The expected balance together with the value of a pre-approved credit line the ASPSP makes permanently available to the user.

            For card-accounts:

            "money to spend with the value of a pre-approved credit limit on the card account"

          - "openingBooked":
            Balance type returned only if a date range is specified in the request paramaters. It is the book balance of the account at the beginning of the requested date range. **(saldo contabile all'inizio del periodo specificato)**
          - "interimAvailable":
            Available balance calculated in the course of the account servicer's business day,
            at the time specified, and subject to further changes during the business day. It always includes the credit limit of the corresponding account ("creditLimitIncluded" flag is always true for this balance type in case of account)
            The interim balance is calculated on the basis of booked credit and debit items during the calculation
            time/period specified. (saldo disponibile in tempo reale)

            This is currently the only balance type available for card-accounts. (plafond sottratto di operazioni contabilizzate e prenotate)
          - "forwardAvailable":
            Forward available balance of money that will be at the disposal of the account owner at the end of the current month. (saldo disponibile a fine mese corrente)
          - "interimBooked":
            Balance calculated in the course of the account servicer's business day, at the time specified, and subject to further changes during the business day.

          - 'CHIP_OTP': An SCA method, where an OTP is generated by a chip card, e.g. an TOP derived from an EMV cryptogram.
            To contact the card, the PSU normally needs a (handheld) device.
            With this device, the PSU either reads the challenging data through a visual interface like flickering or
            the PSU types in the challenge through the device key pad.
            The device then derives an OTP from the challenge data and displays the OTP to the PSU.
          - 'PHOTO_OTP': An SCA method, where the challenge is a QR code or similar encoded visual data
            which can be read in by a consumer device or specific mobile app.
            The device resp. the specific app than derives an OTP from the visual challenge data and displays
            the OTP to the PSU.
          - 'PUSH_OTP': An OTP is pushed to a dedicated authentication APP and displayed to the PSU.
